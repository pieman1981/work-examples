No variation of these Conditions shall be binding upon the Company Owner unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorised representative of the Company Owner.</p>
<h2 class="purple">3. Prices</h2>

<p>(a) Unless expressly stated to the contrary all costs and fees are exclusive of any applicable value added or any other sales tax and any applicable delivery charges, for which the Customer shall be additionally liable.</p>

<p>(b) The Company Owner reserves the right to increase any part of the costs or fees payable:-</p>
<p>(i) in respect of design work where the Customer's requirements are not clear, necessitating the production of additional proofs;</p>
<p>(ii) where poor quality artwork is provided by the Customer necessitating the use of metal plates;</p>
<p>(iii) where the Commissioned Work is ordered more than ten working days prior to delivery, to reflect any increase in the cost to the Company Owner such as, without limitation, increases in the costs of labour, materials or other costs;</p>
<p>(iv) any change in delivery dates, quantities or specifications requested by the Customer,;</p>
<p>(v) any delay caused by any instructions of the Customer changes to the Order, failure of the Customer to give the Company Owner adequate information or failure of the Customer to supply clear or legible copy;</p>
<p>(vi) failure or delay of the Customer to take delivery instructions.</p>

<p>The Company Owner shall seek to notify the Customer of the amount of any increase as soon as reasonably practicable. The Customer shall have the right to cancel the order if the reason for the price increase is as set out in paragraph (iii) above and the price has increased by more than 10% provided notice of cancellation is given by the Customers as soon as reasonably practicable on receiving notification of such increase but the Customer shall pay the Company Owner on a pro rata basis calculated from the costs and fees originally agreed for any part of the Commissioned Work which had been completed at the time of cancellation of the order. If the reason for the increase is as set out in paragraphs (1)(i), (ii), (iv) (v) or (vi) above the Customer may cancel if the price increase is more than 20% and in such circumstances the pro rata costs payable by the Customer shall be calculated on the increased costs.</p>

<p>(c) Without prejudice to the above, the Company Owner will not be bound by any estimate or quotation given until it has received complete instructions and has accepted the Order.</p>

<p>(d) Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Company Owner, payment of the Company Owner's invoices shall be made at the time of delivery of the Commissioned Work.</p>

<p>(e) Customers may apply to become credit account Customers which application may be accepted at the Company Owner's sole discretion. Credit account Customers shall pay the Company Owner within 30 days of the date of the Company Owner's invoice.</p>

<p>(f) If the Customer fails to make payment on the due date, the Company Owner shall be entitled to charge the Customer interest under the Late Payment of Commercial Debt Act 1998 as amended.</p>

<p>(g) The Company Owner may require the Customer to pay a deposit at the time the order is placed. Furthermore, if in the opinion of the Company Owner, the creditworthiness of the Customer shall have deteriorated prior to delivery, the Company Owner may require full or partial payment of the price prior to delivery.</p>
<h2 class="purple">4. Preliminary Work</h2>

<p>The Company Owner shall charge and the Customer shall pay the Company Owner for all preliminary work carried out, whether experimental or otherwise, at the Customer's request. In the event that the Company Owner accepts early termination by the Customer of any preliminary work, the Customer shall pay the Company Owner for the preliminary work, if any, carried out prior to such termination on a pro rata basis.</p>

<h2 class="purple">5. Proofs</h2>

<p>It shall be the responsibility of the Customer to inspect all proofs submitted for approval and the Company Owner shall not be liable to the Customer for any errors not corrected by the Customer in proofs so submitted. The Customer's alterations, except typographical or other errors made by the Company Owner, and any additional proofs necessitated thereby shall be charged extra to the Customer.</p>
<h2 class="purple">6. Full Colour Printing</h2>

<p>(a) Due to the nature of the processes involved, the Company Owner does not guarantee that the Commissioned Work will match the Customer's Materials in colour, saturation or texture.</p>

<p>(b) Customers who require colour reproduction to a specific standard must state this requirement in writing in their order and request a set of wet proofs for each item to be printed. An additional charge shall be made to the Customer for this service which shall be agreed with the Customer prior to commencement of the Commissioned Work.</p>

<p>(c) The Customer shall be responsible for ensuring that the Customer's Materials supplied are suitable for full colour printing and the Customer's attention is brought to Condition 20(b) in this respect.</p>
<h2 class="purple">7. Variations in Quantity</h2>

<p> Company Owner shall endeavour to deliver the correct quantity of the Commissioned Work but orders for the Commissioned Work are accepted on the condition that the Customer accepts a margin of 5% (or 10% for colour copies) for over supply or shortfalls in quantity.</p>
<h2 class="purple">8. Delivery</h2>

<p>Delivery of the Commissioned Work shall be made by the Customer collecting the Commissioned Work at the Company Owner's premises at any time after the Company Owner has notified the Customer that the Commissioned Work is ready for collection or, if some other place for delivery is agreed by the Company Owner, by the Company Owner delivering the Commissioned Work to that place.</p>

<p>9. Delivery and Insurance is free within 5 miles. If the place of delivery is outside 5 miles, the Company Owner shall charge for such delivery and insurance at the rates ruling at the date of delivery.</p>

<p>10.

THE COMPANY OWNER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO ANY DELAY BEYOND THE STATED DELIVERY DATE. UNLESS SUCH DELAY HAS BEEN CAUSED BY THE COMPANY OWNER'S FAILURE TO USE ITS ENDEAVOURS TO COMPLY WITH DELIVERY DATES.</p>

<p>11. Where the order is to be delivered in instalments, each delivery shall constitute a separate contract and failure by the Company Owner to deliver any one or more of the instalments in accordance with these Conditions or any claim by the Customer in respect of any one or more of the instalments shall not entitle the Customer to treat the order as a whole as repudiated or cancelled.</p>

<h2 class="purple">12. Risk &amp; Title</h2>

<p>The risk in the Commissioned Work shall pass to the Customer on delivery and the Customer should therefore be insured accordingly.</p>

<p>14. The Company Owner may for the purpose of checking that these Conditions are being complied with or recovering the Commissioned Work enter upon any premises where it is stored or where the Company Owner reasonably believes it to be stored.</p>

<p>15. Until payment is made the Customer shall possess the Commissioned Work as fiduciary agent and bailee only and shall store each item of the Commissioned Work securely and separately from the Customer's own goods or those of any other person or previously Commissioned Work and in a manner which makes them readily identifiable by reference to the Company Owner's invoices.</p>

<p>16. The Customer's right to possession of the Commissioned Work shall cease if any of the events described in Condition 29 occurs.</p>
