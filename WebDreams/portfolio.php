                       <p>King and Co is a company based in Colchester, Essex that specializes in Sage Training, Sage Consultancy and reselling Sage Resellers. After experiencing problems with the company they originally hired to build their website, they approached web-dreams.co.uk. We took a look at the work that had been in progress, and decided it was in the company’s best interest that we start from scratch.</p>

						<p>After approving the custom redesign we created, which included a new logo, letterhead and business cards, we commenced building the site. Within three weeks of starting the project, we had the website not only up and running, and looking great, but thanks to our skillful knowledge of search engine optimization, being rapidly indexed by Google.</p>

 
						<p>Almost immediately, King and Co saw traffic flooding their website and numerous enquires rolling in. By tagging key search terms like 'Sage training Essex' and 'Sage consultancy Essex' the site was appearing within the 1st page of Google's search results… and still is.</p>

                       <p>Hertford Osteopathic Clinic is based in Hertford, Herts and specializes in pain relief back massages.</p>

<p>A chance encounter with the owner at a 10k race - She was providing massage services to tired runners – led to a conversation about their company website which had been created seven years prior and was in desperate need of a makeover.</p>

<p>After having the new design approved by the owner, web-dreams.co.uk developed the site. We also managed the purchase of a dot com domain name for the site, and prepared the site to go live.</p>

<p>You can still see the site live for yourself. It has achieved some excellent Google rankings for search terms such as 'Osteopathic Clinic Hertford' which appears top of page 1 of Google.</p>

                        <p>A freelance social media producer approached web-dreams.co.uk about building a Wordpress-powered blogging site.</p>

<p>She intended to share her thoughts and opinions on industry news with her peers in an environment which both gave her the appearance of being technically savvy and was easy to maintain.</p>

<p>After designing a logo and a prototype design of the site, we built a custom theme, purchased her requested domain name and installed wordpress on her server. We also implemented social media buttons onto the site and integrated her own Twitter feed so that her latest tweets are automatically displayed in real-time. Her blog posts are also linked with her Twitter and Facebook so that whenever she publishes new material, her friends and followers are alerted so they can retweet, 'like' and digg her blog post.</p>

<p>The site continues to gain steady traffic and the blog content receives regular comments from a loyal band of readers.</p>
